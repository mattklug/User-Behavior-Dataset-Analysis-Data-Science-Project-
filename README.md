Mobile User Behavior Analysis

Introduction --

This project focuses on understanding how people use their mobile devices and applications. By analyzing data on app usage, screen time, data consumption, and battery drain, we aim to answer key questions like: What factors influence mobile app usage? How do age and device type impact phone usage patterns? Using data science methods, we will explore these trends and develop models to predict user behavior and help improve mobile experiences.

Data Source --

The dataset used for this analysis comes from Kaggle, specifically the Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset. It includes information such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and demographic details. This data will help us better understand how users interact with their mobile devices.
